### NFA to DFA

A non deterministic finite automaton is a finite automaton that can have multiple transitions from a state with the same input. A deterministic finite automaton is a finite automaton that has only one transition from a state with the same input. A non deterministic finite automaton can be converted to a deterministic finite automaton by taking the transition table:

| State  | 0     | 1   |
| ------ | ----- | --- |
| q0     | q0,q1 | q2  |
| q1     | -     | q2  |
| q2 (F) | 0     | -   |

And then converting it to a DFA transition table by converting superposition states to composite states:

| DFA State | 0       | 1   |
| --------- | ------- | --- |
| {q0}      | {q0,q1} | q2  |
| {q0,q1}   | {q0,q1} | q2  |
| q2 (F)    | 0       | -   |

## Objectives:

1. Understand what an automaton is and what it can be used for.

2. Continuing the work in the same repository and the same project, the following need to be added:

   a. Provide a function in your grammar type/class that could classify the grammar based on Chomsky hierarchy.

   b. For this you can use the variant from the previous lab.

3. According to your variant number (by universal convention it is register ID), get the finite automaton definition and do the following tasks:

   a. Implement conversion of a finite automaton to a regular grammar.

   b. Determine whether your FA is deterministic or non-deterministic.

   c. Implement some functionality that would convert an NFA to a DFA.

   d. Represent the finite automaton graphically (Optional, and can be considered as a bonus point).

## Implementation description

### Setup

This project is written in TypeScript and uses Vitest for testing. It has a github actions CI pipeline to run the tests, so the verification of the code is automated without having to clone the repository. All tests will be placed in the `./tests` folder and the specs are grouped by the laboratory for simplicity.

This laboratory includes a demo for visualization and it can be run by first doing the instruction in the [README](../README.md) and then running `pnpm run demo:graph`.

### Grammar

The grammar from the first laboratory is not a good fit for this one and I renamed it to `RegularGrammar` and created a new `Grammar` class that accepts multiple words for the left side of the production.

```ts
// src/grammar/grammar.ts
export type Production = {
  from: string[];
  to: string[];
};

export class Grammar {
  constructor(
    readonly start: string,
    readonly productions: Production[],
    readonly nonTerminal: string[],
    readonly terminal: string[],
  ) {}

  getClassification():
    | "regular"
    | "context-free"
    | "context-sensitive"
    | "recursive";
  private isRegular(): boolean;
  private isContextFree(): boolean;
  private isContextSensitive(): boolean;
}
```

The `getClassification` method is used to determine the type of grammar in Chomsky hierarchy according to point 2.a.

Here is a code snippet on one of the sub methods (it checks for both left to right and right to left regularity):

```ts
// src/grammar/grammar.ts
private isRegular(): boolean {
    const { nonTerminal, terminal } = this;

    return this.productions.every(({ from, to }) => {
      const isFromNonTerminal =
        from.length === 1 && nonTerminal.includes(from[0]);
      const isToRegularLeftToRight = to
        .slice(0, -1)
        .every((word) => terminal.includes(word));
      const isToRegularRightToLeft = to
        .slice(1)
        .every((word) => terminal.includes(word));

      return (
        isFromNonTerminal && (isToRegularLeftToRight || isToRegularRightToLeft)
      );
    });
  }
```

### Finite Automaton

Some foreshadowing, here are some utilities for formatting composite states:

```ts
// src/state-machine/automaton.ts
export type Transition = {
  readonly from: string;
  readonly to: string;
  readonly effect: string;
};

const formatCompositeState = (states: string[]): string => {
  if (states.length === 0) {
    return "";
  }
  if (states.length === 1) {
    return states[0];
  }
  return `{${states.join(",")}}`;
};

const unpackCompositeState = (state: string): string[] => {
  if (state.startsWith("{") && state.endsWith("}")) {
    return state.slice(1, -1).split(",");
  }
  return [state];
};
```

The `Automaton` class is initialized with a list of transitions, final states and the initial state. It's methods allow for checking if it's deterministic, converting it to a grammar, converting it to a DFA and serializing it into [Dot notation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)>) for visualization. The conversion to DFA method uses a queue to analyze the transitions row by row and creates a new `Automaton` instance.

```ts
// src/state-machine/automaton.ts
export class Automaton {
  private readonly _initialState: string;
  private readonly _states: string[];
  private readonly _effects: string[];
  private readonly _transitions: Transition[];
  private readonly _finalStates: string[];

  constructor(
    initialState: string,
    states: string[],
    transitions: Transition[],
    finalStates: string[],
  ) {
    this._initialState = initialState;
    this._states = states;
    this._transitions = transitions;
    this._finalStates = finalStates;

    this._effects = [...new Set(transitions.map((t) => t.effect))];
  }

  private transitionToProduction(transition: Transition): RegularProduction;
  toGrammar(): RegularGrammar;
  isDeterministic(): boolean;
  toDeterministic(): Automaton;
  serializeToDot(name = "automaton"): string;
}
```

## Conclusions / Screenshots / Results

### Conclusions & Results

In this laboratory work I learned how to implement programmatically the conversion of an NFA to DFA. I also learned how to determine the Chiomsky hierarchy of a grammar better by making an algorithm for that. For the visualization part, I learned and used the [Dot notation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)>) for the first time. Writing the conversion was not hard, as the language is very declarative and laconic. For the visualization i used a web implementation of the [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) library (run the demo to get a link).

The objectives of this laboratory were met and the unit tests are proof of that:
